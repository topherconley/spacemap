  - title: R package overview
    desc: The functions of the spaceMap R package are perhaps best conceptualized in three categories. The model fitting category concerns functions that learn a network from input data. The model selection category encompasses functions that select the optimal tuning parameters and build robust networks through aggregation. The  network analysis category contains tools to annotate and interpret inferred networks.
